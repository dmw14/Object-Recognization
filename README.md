# 🧠 Object Recognition Model (MobileNetSSD + OpenCV)

This project implements a **real-time object recognition system** using a **pre-trained MobileNetSSD model** with **OpenCV’s Deep Neural Network (DNN)** module.  
It can detect and classify common objects from a webcam feed, displaying bounding boxes and confidence scores for each detected object.
